# AI-CheckMate ü§ñ‚û°Ô∏èüßë

AI-CheckMate is a web-based tool designed to analyze text and determine the likelihood of it being generated by AI. It also features a powerful "humanization" engine that can rewrite AI-generated text to appear more natural and human-like, with options for different tones.

This project is built with a Python Flask backend and a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend. It leverages powerful open-source language models for its core functionality.

## Features

- **AI Detection:** Paste in any text to get a percentage score of its AI likelihood based on metrics like perplexity and burstiness.
- **Text Humanization:** Rewrite text to sound more human. Choose from different tones like Neutral, Formal, or Conversational.
- **GPU Accelerated:** The backend is optimized to use NVIDIA GPUs for fast model inference, making it perfect for deployment on platforms like Google Colab.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** A sleek, modern interface with a theme toggle for user comfort.

## How to Run in Google Colab

This application is designed to be run in a Google Colab notebook to take advantage of free GPU resources.

1.  **Open the Colab Notebook:** Use the official "AI-CheckMate Colab Notebook" to run this application.
2.  **Upload Your Fine-Tuned Model:** The humanization feature requires a fine-tuned model. Inside the Colab environment, you will be prompted to upload your model checkpoint files to the `FineTuning_phi3/checkpoint-500/` directory.
3.  **Run the Cells:** Execute the cells in the notebook in order. The final cell will install all dependencies from `requirements.txt` and launch the web server using `ngrok`, providing you with a public URL to access the application.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, PEFT
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Deployment:** Google Colab, Ngrok
